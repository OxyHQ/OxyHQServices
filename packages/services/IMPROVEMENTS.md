# UI and Performance Improvements Summary

This document outlines the improvements made to address UI issues, bottom sheet problems, performance optimizations, and API integration gaps.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Library Dependencies ✅
- **Problem**: Build failures due to missing lib wrapper files for sonner, bottomSheet, and icons
- **Solution**: Created wrapper files in `src/lib/` for cross-platform compatibility
  - `sonner.ts`: Toast functionality wrapper for React Native and web
  - `bottomSheet.ts`: Bottom sheet components wrapper using React Native base components
  - `icons.tsx`: Icon components wrapper with fallback for missing @expo/vector-icons

### 2. API Integration Issues ✅
- **Problem**: FollowButton was using mock API calls instead of real OxyServices methods
- **Solution**: Updated FollowButton to use actual `followUser()` and `unfollowUser()` API methods
- **Problem**: ProfileScreen was displaying mock data for followers/following counts
- **Solution**: Updated ProfileScreen to fetch real data using `getUserFollowers()` and `getUserFollowing()` APIs

### 3. Performance Optimizations ✅
- **Bottom Sheet Animations**: 
  - Fixed `useNativeDriver` to be enabled on all platforms for better animation performance
  - Removed conditional animation disabling on Android that was causing performance issues
  - Standardized animation initial values across platforms
  
- **Component Memoization**:
  - Added `React.memo` to `Avatar`, `FollowButton`, and `OxyLogo` components
  - This prevents unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed

### 4. UI Component Enhancements ✅
- **ProfileScreen**: Added display for posts and comments counts (shows '--' when API not available)
- **FollowButton**: Enhanced error handling and proper API response processing
- **Animation Consistency**: Fixed cross-platform animation behavior in bottom sheet

### 5. Testing ✅
- Added comprehensive tests for FollowButton API integration
- Tests verify proper API calls and error handling

## Performance Impact

The optimizations provide:
1. **Faster Animations**: Native driver usage on both iOS and Android
2. **Reduced Re-renders**: Memoized components only re-render when props change
3. **Better Cross-platform Consistency**: Unified animation behavior
4. **Improved API Integration**: Real-time data instead of mock responses

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Future Improvements

1. **Posts/Comments APIs**: When content management APIs become available, update ProfileScreen to fetch real post/comment counts
2. **Additional Performance**: Consider implementing selective subscriptions from `stateOptimizations.ts` for heavy data screens
3. **Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries for better error handling
4. **Loading States**: Enhanced loading states with skeleton screens

## Features

- üîê **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with automatic token refresh
- üë• **User Management**: Profile operations and social features
- üé® **UI Components**: Pre-built React components for common functionality
- üì± **Cross-Platform**: Works in React Native and web applications
- üîß **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @oxyhq/services
```

```typescript
import { OxyServices } from '@oxyhq/services';

const oxy = new OxyServices({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000'
});

// Authenticate
const response = await oxy.auth.login({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});

// Get current user
const user = await oxy.users.getCurrentUser();
```

- [üíº Integration Examples](./docs/examples/)

## UI Components

Import and use pre-built React components:

```typescript
import { OxyProvider, Avatar, FollowButton } from '@oxyhq/services/ui';
```

## Package Exports

The library provides multiple entry points:

```typescript
// Core services only (Node.js/Express)
import { OxyServices } from '@oxyhq/services';

// UI components only (React/React Native)
import { OxyProvider, Avatar } from '@oxyhq/services/ui';

// Full package (Core + UI)
import { OxyServices, OxyProvider } from '@oxyhq/services/full';
```

## Zero-Config Express Router

Quickly mount authentication routes in any Express app:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { createAuth } from '@oxyhq/services/core';

const app = express();
app.use('/auth', createAuth({ baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000' }).middleware());
```

This automatically provides sign-up, login, logout, refresh, and session management endpoints.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 16+ (for backend usage)
- **React** 16.8+ (for React components)
- **React Native** 0.60+ (for mobile components)
- **TypeScript** 4.0+ (optional but recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### FormData Issues in React Native/Expo

If you encounter `ReferenceError: Property 'FormData' doesn't exist` when using Expo with Hermes engine:

The library automatically includes polyfills for React Native environments that lack native FormData support. The `form-data` package is included as a dependency and will be used as a fallback when native FormData is not available.

**For file uploads in React Native/Expo:**
- The library handles this automatically - no additional setup required
- File uploads will work with both native FormData (when available) and the polyfilled version
- Ensure you're using the latest version of the package

### Additional Dependencies

For React Native projects, you may need to install peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install axios jwt-decode invariant
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the library
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Development mode
npm run dev
```

## Integration

This library works with:
- **[Oxy API](../oxy-api/)** - The companion authentication server
- **Express.js** - Built-in middleware support
- **React/React Native** - UI components and hooks
- **Next.js** - SSR/SSG authentication

/**
 * Per-surface route history — the NAV-WITHIN axis.
 *
 * Bloom's surface stack owns DEPTH (a surface presented on top of another). This
 * store owns the ORTHOGONAL axis: the route history INSIDE one SDK surface. Each
 * SDK surface holds its own {@link SurfaceNavStack}; `navigate`/`replace`/`goBack`
 * mutate it and the SAME Bloom surface re-renders its content from the new top
 * frame. It is the per-surface reincarnation of the old global
 * `bottomSheetStore`'s `history` + `currentStep`.
 *
 * `closing`/`closeResult` model a pending dismissal: the surface's `SurfaceScreen`
 * watches them and calls the Bloom surface's `dismiss(result)` from an effect —
 * so a dismiss requested BEFORE the surface has mounted still resolves once it
 * does, with no controls-capture race and no render-phase side effect.

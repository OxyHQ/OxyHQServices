# Bottom Sheet Navigation Transition Fixes

## Issues Identified

The bottom sheet navigation was experiencing buggy transitions when navigating between screens due to several concurrent issues:

### 1. Race Conditions in Navigation
- Multiple navigation events firing simultaneously
- 100ms polling interval interfering with transitions
- No debouncing mechanism for rapid navigation calls

### 2. Animation Conflicts
- Bottom sheet animations conflicting with screen transition animations
- Snap point changes happening during navigation animations
- Lack of coordination between different animation systems

### 3. State Management Issues
- Multiple setState calls happening simultaneously during navigation
- No navigation state tracking to prevent conflicts
- Snap points updating unnecessarily causing unwanted animations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Navigation Debouncing and State Management

**File**: `src/ui/navigation/OxyRouter.tsx`
- Added `NAVIGATION_DEBOUNCE_MS = 150` constant for consistent timing
- Implemented navigation state tracking with `isNavigating` flag
- Added debouncing logic to prevent rapid navigation calls
- Improved cleanup for navigation timeouts

```typescript
// Debounce rapid navigation calls
if (now - lastNavigationTimeRef.current < NAVIGATION_DEBOUNCE_MS) {
    console.log('[OxyRouter] Navigation debounced:', screen);
    return;
}
```

### 2. Snap Point Animation Coordination

**File**: `src/ui/components/OxyProvider.tsx`
- Added `SNAP_POINT_ANIMATION_DELAY = 200ms` to coordinate with navigation
- Improved snap point adjustment to only update when actually changed
- Added coordination between navigation and snap point changes

```typescript
// Add a small delay to ensure navigation animation completes first
const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    adjustSnapPoints(routes[currentScreen].snapPoints);
}, SNAP_POINT_ANIMATION_DELAY);
```

### 3. Animation Coordination System

**File**: `src/ui/components/OxyProvider.tsx`
- Added `coordinateNavigationAnimation()` function for smooth transitions
- Reset animations before starting to prevent conflicts
- Integrated navigation animation with existing bottom sheet animations

```typescript
const coordinateNavigationAnimation = useStableCallback(() => {
    // Slight fade animation to smooth navigation transitions
    Animated.sequence([
        Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
            toValue: 0.7,
            duration: 100,
            useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
        Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
            toValue: 1,
            duration: 200,
            useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
    ]).start();
}, [fadeAnim]);
```

### 4. Navigation State Hook

**File**: `src/ui/hooks/useNavigationState.ts`
- Created reusable hook for managing navigation state
- Provides debouncing utilities and state management
- Can be used across components for consistent navigation behavior

### 5. Polling Optimization

**File**: `src/ui/navigation/OxyRouter.tsx`
- Reduced polling frequency from 100ms to 200ms
- Added navigation state checks to prevent polling during transitions
- Improved cleanup and memory management

## Benefits

1. **Smoother Transitions**: Navigation between screens now has coordinated animations
2. **No More Race Conditions**: Debouncing prevents multiple navigation calls from interfering
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced polling frequency and unnecessary state updates
4. **Improved UX**: Users won't experience jarring or interrupted transitions
5. **Future-Proof**: Navigation state management can be extended for more complex scenarios

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Rapid Navigation**: Try rapidly tapping navigation buttons - should be smooth without glitches
2. **Screen Transitions**: Navigate between different screen types (full-screen vs. modal) - should animate smoothly
3. **Keyboard Interactions**: Open screens with inputs while keyboard is visible - should handle gracefully
4. **Back Navigation**: Use back navigation during transitions - should be properly blocked or queued

## Usage

The fixes are backward compatible. Existing code will work without changes, but with improved performance and stability.

For new implementations, consider using the navigation state hook:

```typescript
import { useNavigationState } from '../hooks/useNavigationState';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isNavigating, debounceNavigation } = useNavigationState();
  
  const handleNavigation = () => {
    debounceNavigation(() => {
      // Your navigation logic here
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <Button 
      onPress={handleNavigation}
      disabled={isNavigating}
    />
  );
};
```

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes
- All existing APIs remain the same
- Performance improvements should be immediately noticeable
- Consider updating custom navigation logic to use the new state management patterns

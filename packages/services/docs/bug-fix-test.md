# Follower Count Bug Fix Test

This document outlines how to test that the follower count bug has been fixed.

## The Bug

**Problem**: When User A follows User B, the system incorrectly updated User B's "following" count instead of User A's "following" count.

**Expected Behavior**: 
- User B's follower count should increase by 1
- User A's following count should increase by 1
- User B's following count should remain unchanged

## Test Steps

### 1. Setup Test Users

Create two test users:
- User A (current user): `testuser1`
- User B (target user): `testuser2`

### 2. Initial State Check

Before following, verify the initial counts:

```typescript
// User B's profile should show:
// - Followers: X
// - Following: Y

// User A's profile should show:
// - Followers: Z
// - Following: W
```

### 3. Follow Action

Have User A follow User B:

```typescript
// Click FollowButton for User B
<FollowButton userId="user-b-id" />
```

### 4. Verify Count Updates

After following, verify the counts are updated correctly:

**✅ Correct Behavior:**
- User B's followers: X + 1
- User A's following: W + 1
- User B's following: Y (unchanged)

**❌ Old Buggy Behavior:**
- User B's followers: X + 1
- User B's following: Y + 1 (incorrect!)
- User A's following: W (unchanged)

### 5. Unfollow Action

Have User A unfollow User B:

```typescript
// Click FollowButton again (should show "Following")
<FollowButton userId="user-b-id" />
```

### 6. Verify Count Reverts

After unfollowing, verify the counts revert correctly:

**✅ Correct Behavior:**
- User B's followers: X (back to original)
- User A's following: W (back to original)
- User B's following: Y (unchanged)

## API Response Verification

Check that the API returns the correct counts:

```json
// POST /users/user-b-id/follow
{
  "message": "Successfully followed user",
  "action": "follow",
  "counts": {
    "followers": 151,  // User B's follower count
    "following": 26    // User A's following count
  }
}
```

## Zustand Store Verification

Verify the store updates the correct users:

```typescript
// In followStore.toggleFollowUser
const currentUserId = oxyServices.getCurrentUserId(); // User A's ID

// Updates User B's follower count
followerCounts[targetUserId] = counts.followers; // user-b-id: 151

// Updates User A's following count  
followingCounts[currentUserId] = counts.following; // user-a-id: 26
```

## Component Integration Test

Test that components display the correct counts:

```typescript
// ProfileScreen for User B should show:
// - Followers: 151 (increased)
// - Following: Y (unchanged)

// ProfileScreen for User A should show:
// - Followers: Z (unchanged)
// - Following: 26 (increased)
```

## Edge Cases to Test

1. **Multiple Follows**: Follow multiple users and verify each user's counts update correctly
2. **Unfollow**: Unfollow users and verify counts decrease correctly
3. **Profile Switching**: Switch between different user profiles and verify counts are accurate
4. **Real-time Updates**: Have multiple tabs/windows open and verify counts sync across all instances
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when API calls fail

## Expected Results

After the fix:

- ✅ User B's follower count increases when User A follows
- ✅ User A's following count increases when User A follows User B
- ✅ User B's following count remains unchanged
- ✅ Counts update in real-time across all components
- ✅ Counts persist correctly in Zustand store
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in the console

## Rollback Test

If needed, you can temporarily revert the fix to verify the bug was present:

```typescript
// In followStore.toggleFollowUser, change:
followingCounts[currentUserId] = counts.following;

// Back to the buggy version:
followingCounts[targetUserId] = counts.following; // This was wrong!
```

This should reproduce the original bug where User B's following count incorrectly increased.

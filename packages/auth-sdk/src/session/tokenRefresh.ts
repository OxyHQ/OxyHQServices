/**
 * In-session access-token refresh for `@oxyhq/auth`'s `WebOxyProvider`.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES (Fase 4 cutover — Task 5.2): `AuthManager` used to run
 * `setupCookieRefresh` (a timer that re-hit `POST /auth/refresh?authuser=N`
 * against the legacy `oxy_rt_${n}` cookie a fixed buffer before the access
 * token's expiry) plus a reactive `HttpService.setAuthRefreshHandler` that
 * called the SAME cookie-refresh path on a 401 or per-request preflight.
 * Retiring `AuthManager` (Task 5.3) drops BOTH of those without a
 * replacement — this module is that replacement, built entirely on
 * `SessionClient`-era primitives.
 *
 * WHY NOT `SessionClient.bootstrap()` (`GET /session/device/state`): that
 * route is itself bearer-gated (`authMiddleware`), and the server's
 * `resolveActiveToken` only mints a genuinely NEW token when the STORED
 * session's access token has ALREADY expired server-side — which is exactly
 * when the caller's OWN presented bearer (the identical JWT) would ALSO be
 * rejected by `authMiddleware` before ever reaching that logic. Worse,
 * calling it reactively from inside the registered `AuthRefreshHandler`
 * risks a genuine DEADLOCK: `HttpService.refreshAccessToken` guards
 * re-entrancy with a single per-instance `tokenRefreshPromise`, and
 * `bootstrap()`'s own internal request runs through the SAME
 * `getAuthHeader()` preflight check — which, given the near/at-expiry token
 * that triggered the refresh in the first place, would try to await that
 * very same in-flight promise a second time. So `SessionClient` REST calls
 * are deliberately never used here; every arm below mints a session through a
 * credential path that is fully independent of the current bearer.
 *
 * THE FIX, mirroring `@oxyhq/services`'s `inSessionTokenRefresh.ts` (the RN
 * reference implementation) minus its native `AppState`/shared-keychain arm
 * — `@oxyhq/auth` is web-only:
 *
 *  1. {@link createWebAuthRefreshHandler} — an `AuthRefreshHandler` installed
 *     on `oxyServices.httpService`. It re-mints a fresh access token WITHOUT
 *     a page reload by composing the SAME silent-restore primitives cold
 *     boot already relies on (per-apex `/auth/silent` iframe, then FedCM
 *     silent) — not a copy — and commits the result exactly like a winning
 *     cold-boot ladder step would (via the caller-supplied
 *     `commitSilentSession`, which registers the recovered account into the
 *     `SessionClient` device set).
 *
 *  2. {@link startTokenRefreshScheduler} — a proactive scheduler that
 *     refreshes ~{@link TOKEN_REFRESH_LEAD_MS} before expiry (and on web
 *     tab-focus), so the common case never even reaches the reactive
 *     401-then-recover flash.
 *
 * Concurrency/cooldown/dedup are owned by `HttpService.refreshAccessToken`
 * (single in-flight `tokenRefreshPromise` + cooldown) — this module does not
 * reimplement them, so the timer and per-request preflight triggers collapse
 * to one network attempt (no refresh storm).
 */

/**
 * Per-arm fail-fast budget (ms) for the first-party `/auth/silent` iframe
 * arm. Slightly more generous than the cold-boot iframe budget (2.5s)
 * because an in-session refresh is NOT in the first-paint critical path — a
 * couple hundred ms of extra headroom for the same-origin handshake is worth
 * a higher success rate. `silentSignIn` still fail-fasts on `iframe.onerror`,
 * so a hard failure returns well before this.
